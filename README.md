# **ServiceNow Women Code to Win**
## Problem Statement : 
#### How do we use technology to help reduce energy consumption in transportation, buildings, homes, industrial complexes, supply chains and so on? How do we use AI, data modeling, and cloud technologies which can predict environmental issues based on current data sets and patterns? 
### **Project : IOT based Electricity Consumption Analysis and Automation of Appliances**

### GOAL 1 . We have created a hardware prototype for the Automation of Appliances to reduce the electricity wastage when appliances are left turned on by mistake .
### HARDWARE SETUP :
1 . Connecting the appliances to the program .
### **Platform Used**  : Arduino IDE 
    
    Step 1 . Connecting the arduino UNO through the port to the device

    Step 2 . Including Cvzone library so that the human recognition program successfully gets connected to the arduino and hence to the appliances.

    Step 3 . Writing the logic to turn on and off LED's .

### Code for detecting humans and controlling the appliances accordingly. 
Using OpenCv (OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision) . [OpenCv](https://g.co/kgs/mrAQVM) for the detection of a human body and writing a logic to turn on and off the appliances accordingly.

### Goal 2. The second part is the Dashboard created which shows the consumption trends so that we can analyse and work on the areas where there is more electricity wastage.
