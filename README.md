## Problem Statement : Sustainable Environment 
### **Project : IOT based Electricity Consumption Analysis and Automation of Appliances**

### 1 . We have created a hardware prototype for the Automation of Appliances to reduce the electricity wastage when appliances are left turned on by mistake .
### HARDWARE SETUP :
1 . Connecting the appliances to the program . 


### Code for detecting humans and controlling the appliances accordingly. 
Using OpenCv (OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision) . [OpenCv](https://g.co/kgs/mrAQVM) for the detection of a human body and writing a logic to turn on and off the appliances accordingly.  





### 2. The second part is the Dashboard created which shows the consumption trends so that we can analyse and work on the areas where there is more electricity wastage.
